  <b>Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. </b>

Easy to use:

Pre-defined npm scripts:

* `npm run dev` -> run webpack dev server and open browser
* `npm run lint` -> run es-lint
